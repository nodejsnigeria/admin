## Contribution Framework

## Members

Node.js Nigeria Members are administrative and help to remove barriers for Initiatives and Local Chapters under Node.js Nigeria’s scope. Node.js Nigeria Members are involved primarily with decisions that have wider reaching effects than within a single Initiative or individual working group. Node.js Nigeria Members are responsible for making decisions when consensus cannot be reached among Collaborators.

Active Collaborators can self-nominate or be nominated by a Node.js Nigeria Member to become a Member of Node.js Nigeria. On approval by the consensus process, the Collaborator becomes a Member.

Collaborators voted in as Members are given write access to all repositories.

### Director

The primary leader of Node.js Nigeria is acknowledged as the Director. The Director represents Nigeria on the Node.js Africa Board of Directors. The Director is tasked with the responsibility of maintaining Local Chapters within the country and co-ordinating team players to be effective.

### Chairs

It’s the responsibility of the Chair to see that all projects are completed and there are active contributors to Node.js Nigeria from the ecosystem.  A Chair can have a Co-Chair.

## Champions

A Champion is any individual who is the primary leader of a Local Chapter or Initiative.

Typical activities of a Champion include:

-    Bringing together people and structures to coordinate the activities of a Local Chapter or Initiative
-    Reporting to Node.js Nigeria members on issues regarding the activities of a Local Chapter or Initiative
-    Making sure that there are active contributors to the Local Chapter or Initiative from the ecosystem.
-    Helping novice Contributors
-    Contributing code, non-code, and documentation changes that improve a Local Chapter or Initiative
-    Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
-    Merging pull requests

## Collaborators

A Collaborator is anyone who holds a leadership position in the team of a Local Chapter or Initiative. Collaborators have write access to the repositories relevant to their Local Chapter or Initiative.

Typical activities of a Collaborator include:

-    helping novice Contributors
-    contributing code, non-code, and documentation changes that improve a Local Chapter or Initiative
-    reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
-    participating in working groups or Initiatives
-    merging pull requests

The Collaborator list is periodically reviewed to identify inactive Collaborators. An inactive Collaborator is given a probationary period of 2 months, after which such a Collaborator is removed if there is still no improvement in engagement.

## Contributors

Any individual participating in a Local Chapter or Initiative of Node.js Nigeria by:

- commenting on an issue or pull request OR
- creating an issue or pull request

### Becoming a Contributor

To begin contributing to Local Chapters and Initiatives, start participating!

You can attend the meetups of the Local Chapter or Initiative, investigate issues tagged as good first issue, open issues and pull requests, or provide insight via GitHub.


## Chapters

A Local Chapter is a sub-community across a State, led by a Champion.

### Opening A Local Chapter
-    A Local Chapter is to be coordinated on a State level; for example Kano or Oyo.
-    A Local Chapter must have a focus project and a Champion. The Champion must take opening a Local Chapter into full consideration with the Director and the rest of the governing team.
-    An individual (who must be a Collaborator) can open an issue requesting to start a Local Chapter in a location. A Chair is responsible for validating the Local Chapter plan and requesting for a 3 months project/goal before approving a Local Chapter.

        Where there is no project and Chair has considered the idea of having a Local Chapter in a location, a Chair is tasked to prepare a 3 months project for the Local Chapter and seek the approval of Node.js Nigeria Members.

-    A Chair will also create a repository to monitor Local Chapter activities with the name of the Local Chapter e.g. nodejsnigeria/Lagos.
-    A chair will also create a repository to monitor Local Chapter projects e.g. nodejsnigeria/Lagos-p-nodelearn.

### Closing/Suspending A Local Chapter
-    If there is a report of misconduct, a Chair is tasked with looking into the report and considering closing or suspending a Local Chapter.
-    If a Champion is longer available, a Chair is responsible for assigning a new Champion (the proposed Champion must be a Collaborator) or closing the Local Chapter.

## Initiatives
From time to time, Node.js Nigeria might kick off certain projects which are essential for ecosystem growth but cut across various( or all) Local Chapters. An Initiative will have a Champion who oversees and coordinates the affairs of that initiative. Depending on complexity, a team can be formed around an Initiative. Also, an Initiative can be a one-off project and not a continuous one.

Initatives will be reviewed during Member meetings to ensure that they function according to their intended purpose and get as much support as is required.

## Repository Structuring

A Chair is responsible for creating repositories for every Local Chapter and Initiative. The name of the repository must be named thus: **nodejsnigeria/chapter** or **nodejsnigeria/initiative**.

A Chair is responsible for creating a repository for a current project coordinated by a Local Chapter Champion. The name of the repository must be named thus: **nodejsnigeria/chapter-p-project-name:**

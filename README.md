## Chapters

### Opening A Local Chapter
-    A Local Chapter must have a focus project and a Champion. The Champion must take opening a Local Chapter into full consideration with the Director and the rest of the governing team.
-    An individual (who must have been actively contributing to NOde.js Nigeria) can open an issue requesting to start a Local Chapter in a location. A Chair is responsible for validating the Local Chapter plan and requesting for a 3 months project/goal before approving a Local Chapter. Where there is no project and Chair has considered the idea of having a Local Chapter in a location, a Chair is tasked to prepare a 3 months project for the Local Chapter.
-    A Chair will also create a repository to monitor Local Chapter activities with the name of the Local Chapter e.g. nodejsnigeria/lagos.
-    A chair will also create a repository to monitor 3 months interval projects for the Local Chapter e.g. nodejsnigeria/lagos-p-ecommerce.

### Closing/Suspending A Local Chapter or WG
-    If there is a report of misconduct, a Chair is tasked with looking into the report and consider closing or suspending a Local Chapter.
-    If a Champion is longer available, a Chair is responsible for assigning a new Champion (the proposed Champion must be a Collaborator) or closing the Local Chapter.
